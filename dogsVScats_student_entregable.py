# # Lab assignment: dogs VS cats

# <table><tr>
#     <td><img src="img/doge.jpg" style="width:400px;height:400px;"></td>
#     <td><img src="img/cat.jpg" style="width:400px;height:400px;"></td>
# </tr></table>

# In this assignment we will face an image classification problem, trying to tell apart images of dogs and images of cats. The final battle begins! And to do so we will use a Deep Learning approach.

# ## Guidelines

# Throughout this notebook you will find empty cells that you will need to fill with your own code. Follow the instructions in the notebook and pay special attention to the following symbols.

# To avoid missing packages and compatibility issues you should run this notebook under one of the [recommended Deep Learning environment files](https://github.com/albarji/teaching-environments/tree/master/deeplearning), or make use of [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you use Colaboratory make sure to [activate GPU support](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb).

# The following code will embed any plots into the notebook instead of generating a new window:

# In[ ]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# Lastly, if you need any help on the usage of a Python function you can place the writing cursor over its name and press Caps+Shift to produce a pop-out with related documentation. This will only work inside code cells. 
# 
# Let's go!

# ## Data processing

# The images to use in this assignment are available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=105jGDrjEgxx2W2gYhFF8Mbf1J9qJeDPm) as a zip file. Download the data package and extract it into a folder in your computer. It is recommended to run this section of the notebook in your machine, as you might find memory issues when working in Google Colaboratory. Later on we will see how to load the processed data into Colab.

# Data is structured under two folders, *train* and *test*. You are only allowed to use the *test* data to measure the performance of your model **after** you have finished training. Both *train* and *test* folders contain one subfolder per class (*cats* and *dogs*).

# The recommended way to load an image from disk is to use the *imread* function from the *scikit-image* library. For example:

# In[ ]:


from skimage.io import imread

image = imread("./img/sample.jpg")


# This returns the image as 3-dimensional numpy matrix, containing the value of intensity of every pixel in each row, column and color channel.

# In[ ]:


image.shape


# We can visualize the loaded image using

# In[ ]:


plt.imshow(image)


# The dataset includes 20000 training images and 5000 test images, each image at a different resolution. Loading all this data at once requires too much memory, so we will need to **resize** each image to a smaller, common size as we load them from disk. We can do so by again making use of a *scikit-image* function. For example:

# In[ ]:


from skimage.transform import resize

size = 64
smallimage = resize(image, (64, 64, 3), mode="reflect")  # 64 x 64 pixels, 3 color channels
plt.imshow(smallimage)


# In[ ]:


smallimage.shape


# <img src="img/question.png" height="80" width="80" style="float: right;"/>
# 
# ***
# 
# <font color=#ad3e26>
#     
# Perform the following tasks to prepare the data:
# - Build a numpy array *X_train* containing one entry for each training image in the data. Each entry must contain the 3-dimensional matrix of pixels corresponding to an image. Make sure to scale down each image to a common size
# - Normalize *X_train* so that pixels follow a distribution lying in the range [0, 1]
# - Build a corresponding array *Y_train* with the class of each training image (0 for cats and 1 for dogs).
# - Randomly shuffle the data. Make sure you shuffle both *X_train* and *Y_train* using the same permutation, so you don't lose track of the class of each training pattern.
# 
# - Repeat the whole procedure again to generate *X_test* and *Y_test* matrices for the test data.
# </font>
#

# <img src="img/exclamation.png" height="80" width="80" style="float: right;"/>
# 
# ***
# <font color=#2655ad>
#     
# - Take advantage of the *glob* package to generate the filename lists for the indoor and outdoor subfolders.
# - Since you need to repeat the procedure both for training and test data, it would be useful to implement a function that performs all the data loading and transforming steps.

# In[ ]:


datafile = "data.npz"  # Change here the location for the processed data

# #### Note on loading data into Google Colab

# To load data into a Google Colaboratory you will need to upload the processed data file into your Google Drive account. After that, in the Colab notebook you can run 
# 
# ```
# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/drive')
# ```
# 
# to connect all the contents in your Google Drive to the folder `/content/drive`. Then you should be able to run the loading cells above to get the data. For example, if you uploaded the data file directly to the home folder in Google Drive, you should be able to access it using the path `/content/drive/My Drive/data.npz`.

# Create a deep network that achieves at least a 70% of accuracy in the test set. Make use of the layers you seem fit for problem, but you should include at least one layer that makes use of the spatial properties of the images. You cannot use the test data for fitting the network, but you can use it to check the final performance of different network architectures, and select the architecture performing best.</font>

# If you are unable to attain the required 70% of accuracy, or your accuracy is too close to 100%, review the following checklist:
# - Have you mixed training and test data?
# - Have the values of the pixels been normalized?
# - Have you compiled the model with a loss function appropriate for **binary** classification?
# - Have you used ReLU units in the hidden layers? Have you used sigmoid or softmax layers in the output layer?

# You can further improve your results by applying one or more of the following strategies:
# - Keep apart a portion of the training data as a **validation set**. Then use an <a href="https://keras.io/callbacks/#earlystopping">**EarlyStopping strategy**</a> to monitor the loss of these validation data, and stop when training when after a number of iterations such loss has not decreased.
# - Use **image augmentation techniques** to artifically create new training images. To do so, you can make use of <a href="https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/">ImageDataGenerator</a> in Keras.
# - Make use of a pre-trained large network, building your network on top of it. You can find some examples in the [Keras Applications](https://keras.io/applications/) page. Be careful when freezing pre-trained networks that include [BatchNormalization layers](http://blog.datumbox.com/the-batch-normalization-layer-of-keras-is-broken/), such as ResNet.
# - Make use of **metamodelling techniques** to select the best architecture parameters for the networks. You can use scikit-learn methods GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV. You can do those by using the <a href="https://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/">KerasClassifier</a> wrapper. Even better, you can mix KerasClassifier with an advanced search method such as [BayesSearch](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/#skopt.BayesSearchCV), included in the [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) library. If you get memory problems try to free GPU memory before building each network by [clearing the tensorflow session](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50895110/what-do-i-need-k-clear-session-and-del-model-for-keras-with-tensorflow-gpu).
# 
# If you correctly use these techniques you should be able to improve your model. With some effort it is possible to up to a 90% test accuracy. Try to do your best!</font>
#

# <a style= 'color:blue'>We have improved the model using pretrained model VGG16 frizing all the convolutional layers and adding 3 more dense layers. Also we included in the train early stopping to know the correct epochs that obtain the better accuracy and not overfit.

# - To this analysis we will consider errors, those amounts where the differences are higher to 0.51, this means that we will consider an error if the model think that it is more probable that the photo has the incorrect class.

# CONCLUSIONS
# 
# The model has recognized only 27 dogs and 1 cat with 0 error. 
# 
# The only cat that the model recognized was in the foreground so it shows clearly the raised ears and the whiskers.
# 
# It recognize dogs better when the photos have no other elements, when the background is plain, when the dogs are looking to the camera and when them have floppy ears.
# 
# The model make mistakes when there are more elements in the photos, more than one animal, or people, or even if the animal is not looking directly to the camera and it is showing its side face.
# 
# Even the model is predicting with no errors more dogs than cats, it is also making more mistakes in predicting dogs. It predicted 352 times that it was a cat when it was a dog and 135 times that it was a dog when it was a cat.
# 
# There are photos were is not possible to recognize even for me if there is a dog or a cat. So this are not considering real errors.
# 
# But it is a pattern that when there are more elements in the photo it is more difficult for the model to recognize the correct class. The training test must include more photos with elements so it can improve this in test too.

# <a style= 'color:blue'> To start, we have run a model with only 1 convolutional layer, and 2 dense layers, this model didn¬¥t give pretty good results. And it overfitted a lot. 
# 
# Then we have added 3 convolutional layers, though each one adds more computation expenses, with this we tipically add the number of filters so the model can learn more complex representations.
# 
# We have added 2 pooling layers, It's important not to have too many pooling layers, as each pooling discards some data. Pooling too often will lead to there being almost nothing for the densely connected layers to learn about when the data reaches them.
# 
# In this case, since the images are small we didn't pool more than twice.
# 
# Then we added the first Dense layer. Here we added a kernel constraint to regularize the data as it learns, another thing that helps prevent overfitting. And finally the last dense layer with one neuron as this is a binomial classifier model.
# 
# We added dropout in all our layers too, at the begining we run a model without dropout in all the layers and it was overfitting, after add dropout we obtain a pretty good accuracy and the model was not overfitting as we can see in the metrics above (91.83% for train and 85.92% for test). 
# 
# Finally the model was improved using the pretrained model VGG16, frizing all the convolutional layers and adding 3 more dense layers. Also we included early stopping to know the correct epochs that obtain the better accuracy and not overfit. The model stops in 3 epochs, achiving 90% in test and 92% in train. And loss of 0.24
# 
# The difference between the model that i obtained with the VGG16 are the layers, VGG16 include as the name say 16 layers, in terms of accuracy it doesnt grow that much, comparing that i used only 4 layers and obtained a 85% and with 12 more we only grow 5 porcentual points. But the real advantage at running VGG16 are the computional costs, as the layers were frized the model only train with the last dense layers, and that is an optimization of computational costs.
